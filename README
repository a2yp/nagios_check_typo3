Nagios(R) TYPO3 Monitoring
Michael Schams - http://schams.net


DESCRIPTION:

Nagios(R) is the industry standard in open source server/service/network
monitoring. This plugin for Nagios(R) reads and parses information about the
TYPO3 instance and reports the status to the Nagios(R) core.

Depending to the configuration (the plugin and Nagios(R) itself), Nagios(R)
detects a specific state (warning or critical) and runs its notification or
event handling procedures.

In short words: this plugin in combination with the TYPO3 extension allows
system administrators/managers to detect things such as outdated/insecure TYPO3
extensions, outdated/insecure TYPO3 core installations, incompatible PHP
versions, etc.
